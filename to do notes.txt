Ok, I figured out how to call a component inside another component with my menu. Also with that hack inside the Image component I found. 
I wont use that for the the menu, but maybe for other images.

Now I need to make the main menu and log in page. 	

Then I need to make the overview page. First with dummy text, and then something that uses mongoDB. 
Then make the navigation work, with over showing preview, and clicking commiting to it.
